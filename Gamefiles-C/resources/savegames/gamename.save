!! WARNING NOT FUNCTIONALLY FILE !! ONLY AS CONCEPT !!

game field is saved like this:

0200                                                3                           0 2
 ^                                                  ^                           ^ ^----------------------------------,
field size, squared so only one number needed | number of maximum player | first digit for the player himself , second number  for the base placement on the field (important because of the building permissions on the map
so together:
0300|3|00|12|23|31\n
0300300122331\n

all textures are already loaded, so we only check which texture gets where;

00{             10001000\n05000321}
^                   ^
texture_ID |x,y coordinates; separated by '\n'
example
00\n
{\n
10001000\n
05000321\n
05390673\n
...\n
}\n
01\n
{\n
...\n
}\n

the newlines are for readability and better modding possibilities

every line one unit/building, starting with the main-players units:
0           01     100                    04                10001000                                0||1                                                   01             10000                                 10001000                    10001000

Player | Unit_ID | Health of unit | Frame of animation | x,y position on game board (4 digit) | is on idle, if yes (1) proceed to the next line (\n) | what action | unit_NUM of attacked/followed unit | x,y location of action (if attack move on unit move to x,y)
